- rxnoresponsewaittime is changed by hardware
- after setting rec_on we have to wait at least 6ms before measuring RSSI level
- gen2StoreTagId: by reading out content of PC only one byte is allowed to be read otherwise the REQ_RN command will fail.
- TX and RX interrupt is hard to detect, SW has to detect 1->0 transition 
- parallel mode single read from FIFO does not pop byte
- serial mode single read from FIFO does not pop byte on AS3991
- workaround for serial AS3991 FIFO reading must not be applied in gen2StoreTagID when reading first byte PC
- AS399X_CMD_SOFTINIT breaks serial communication on AS992
- AS3992 needs additional delay after enabling chip
- AS3992 Version 5.5 has also Version number 5.1
