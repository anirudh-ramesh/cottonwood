Before calling any of the functions herein the A\-S399\-X chip needs to be initialized using \doxyref{as399x\-Initialize()}{p.}{as399x_8c_a3bfe6fab3c61cffe7329b050c4523fc5}. Thereafter the function iso6b\-Open() needs to be called for opening a session.

The following graph shows several states of an I\-S\-O 6\-B tag as well as their transitions based on iso6b$\ast$ commands.

It can be seen that iso6b\-Read() and iso6b\-Write() can be called without a prior inventory round. Both commands, however, do need the U\-I\-D of the tag which can only be determined by calling iso6b\-Inventory\-Round().
